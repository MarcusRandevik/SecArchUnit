# More feedback on initial testing of constraints, 2020-02-27

## What security policies can we write as rules?

E.g. expose object through method -> cache object in new field -> expose new field through method  
Can this sort of information flow be constrained?

E.g. object always passed around in encrypted form

Evaluation of underlying structure, "call graph" in ArchUnit

## Systematic mapping tree

Imagine tree-graph:  
```
Asset  
    C
        reveal
            semantics of specific rules...
                syntax of rules in ArchUnit...
                    limitations of these rules
        transmit
        store
    I
    A
    A
```

Systematically go through concerns -> rules -> limitations  
When we know the limits, we can start thinking of how to extend the framework

Jasser "Constraining..." rules as inspiration, map to tree-graph
As an example, rule 14 is tough; how do we ensure the **absence** of functionality?

## What's next

**Now**  
Systematically map concerns to rules, investigate if they can be enforced.

**2020-03-11**  
In-person meeting at 13:15, aim to be able to discuss limitations.
