# Implementation, Thesis Structure, Half-Time Presentation, 2020-03-20

## Validation

We express concerns that some constraints (e.g. authentication enforcer) will be difficult to validate, as we have to find systems where they are applicable.

It may be fine if we don't validate all the constraints. We can focus on validating the constraints related to the tool extension.
These are in the confidentiality category and should be applicable to most systems.

## Thesis outline

Rough notes ahead.

```
1. Introduction
- Research questions
	- What arch sec constraints be supported with ArchUnit (support=represent/enforce)
	- What is the potentiality to cover more properties via tool extensions / what are
	  the tool extension in order to cover a wider set of archi sec constraints

2. Related work and Background
- ArchUnit
- Security Arch constraints
- Enforcement of constraints (design level, code level)

3. Method

4. Selection of arch sec constraints
- Uber-list
- Enforceable list (scope) - MIDTERM

5. Solution - MIDTERM
- Support in ArchUnit as is
- with annotations
- SechArchUnit 

6. Evaluation
- Selection of the systems to test - MIDTERM
```

## Presentation outline

Maximum 6-8 slides, 15 minutes

Rough slides:

* ArchUnit description, an example such as layered arch
* Research questions
* Security properties
  * What papers we looked at
  * The compiled list that we want to support
* The three ways of enforcing constraints (as is, code annotations, tool extension)
* One part on each of the three ways
* Validation plan
* Planning - where we are, what is done/missing, when we think we will finish things

## What's next
