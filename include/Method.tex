\chapter{Methodology}

This chapter describes the adopted method for collecting relevant constraints, relating these to the common security-goals of CIAA, and later mapping them to functionality within ArchUnit. Second, this chapter presents the validation plan for expressing security constraints with ArchUnit, both by comparing it to industry used static analysis tools and a separate analysis focusing on constraints that could only be expressed in ArchUnit.

\section{Identification of architectural constraints}

The evaluation of SecArchUnit was based on the reliability to detect violations of security architectural constraints. In the absence of any pre-existing set of constraints, the first part of our study was devoted to collecting relevant constraints. The following sections describe the two-part process of collecting and filtering said constraints. 

\subsection{Data collection} \label{sec:data_collection}

The relevance of the security architectural constraints included in the study was ensured by performing a review of security measures and common weaknesses and compiling the result to a list of constraints. Completeness was not the primary goal of the review, but rather to provide a set of constraints derived from previous knowledge. Presented below are the three sources used to form the final list. 

\textbf{CAWE catalog:}
The Common Architectural Weakness Enumeration catalog \cite{santos_catalog_2017} details 224 common weaknesses in security architectures. Each entry has a description of the weakness and exemplifications of how it could manifest itself in the source code, when applicable. In some entries, there are recommendations on what techniques can be used to detect the weakness, along with mitigation strategies.

\textbf{Security patterns:}
Similar to the usage of general design patterns made famous in \cite{gamma_design_1995}, security patterns provide a reusable and domain-independent solution to a known problem. More specifically, this study focused on security patterns for the design phase, as defined in \cite{yoshioka_survey_2008}. While the security pattern repository\footnote{\url{http://sefm.cs.utsa.edu/repository/}} lists over 170 security patterns, not all are provided with sufficient detail or at the appropriate level of abstraction. As a result, the report by Scandariato et al. \cite{scandariato_system_2006}  which provides a filtered list of patterns, were used instead.


\textbf{Security rules:} \label{subsec:security_rules}
Architectural security rules constrain the implementation of a system while being less solution-oriented compared to security patterns. Eden and Kazman differentiate architectural security rules from those defined on a level of source code based on two criteria, locality and intension/extension \cite{eden_architecture_2003}. Architectural rules are both non-local and intensional, meaning that they affect all or several parts of the system while having \say{infinitely-many possible instances}. In \cite{franch_constraining_2019}, Jasser presents a catalog of architectural security rules. Although the entire catalog of 150 security rules is not yet available, the initial list of 22 included in the paper was used in our study.

\subsection{Filtering}\label{sec:processing}

%Elaborate. Perhaps explaining how the sources were analyzed. Did you analyse one right after the other, were there iterations, did you meet after each iteration to discuss your findings and synchronize individually derived subset, or did you work together? How many constraints were taken from individual sources, which of those were grouped? What is the proportion of CIAA coverage in the final list (Show CIAA in table 4.2 and show #ID linking the chosen ones from 4.1)? What was the rational for grouping? Perhaps explicitly enumerating  the "rules" you followed for inclusion would be nice (if there are more than two :) ...), e.g.:
%1) only security related architectural constraints were considered
%2) only constraints that can be enforced statically (FYI: prepare for the question, what is an example of a constraint that can not be statically enforced?),
%3) ...
Starting from each of the three sources of architectural constraints described in Section~\ref{sec:data_collection}, the first step of the process, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mapping_process}, was to select the entries that could be formulated as enforceable constraint in the context of our project. The criteria for inclusion were the following: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The entry must be related to the architectural design of a system, i.e., non-local and intensional (as described in Section~\ref{subsec:security_rules}). \label{criterion_1}
    \item It must be possible to enforce the entry through the static analysis of source-code. An example on a non enforceable constraint is \say{No two instances of a microservice are deployed on the same machine} \cite{franch_constraining_2019}, as the number of machines deployed is a deployment-time property. \label{criterion_2}
    \item Although somewhat included in the first criterion as it is a local issue, an entry must not relate to the correctness or best practice of the implementation of an algorithm. Examples include the practice of using session tokens with time-limited validity. \label{criterion_3}
    \item The entry must only relate to the system under design, thus ignoring the correctness and security of any external dependencies. An example can be found in SonarQube where the usage of a version of a library with known vulnerabilities is reported as a weakness. \label{criterion_4}
    \item The entry must not be dependent on externally defined data. A common example is that of user permissions where the mapping between a regulated function and a users rights is performed using an access control list, external to the source code. \label{criterion_5}
    \item Additionally, we deemed entries defined as the absence of certain functionality as less valuable due to the increased difficulty of enforcing them \cite{haley_security_2008}. An example of such an entry is \say{The system must not provide functionality to decrypt secured log messages}, as defined in \cite{franch_constraining_2019}.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

Previous research on design notations of secure systems have shown a skew towards confidentiality and integrity while having little or no support for availability and accountability. We considered it necessary for the final list of constraints to include all of the security goals. As a consequence, once we had selected the applicable entries, we categorized them according to the security goals of CIAA, ensuring that the final list of constraints covered all security goals. 

The last part of compiling a list of security architectural constraints involved combining the selected entries to remove duplicates and group similar concepts. Duplication involved both a single source having several entries, such as CAWE having input validation weakness for multiple tools and technologies (e.g., SQL, LDAP) and different sources having entries for the same concept, such as the security pattern input guard and the previously mentioned input validation weaknesses. Grouping similar concepts also allowed for the constraints to be more general, thus making them applicable for a broader set of systems. 



\section{Evaluation of the proposed approach}\label{sec:evaluation}

This work followed the research design described in \cite{stol_abc_2018} as a \say{solution-seeking + sample study.}  The first part, solution-seeking, covers the overall idea of proposing a solution to an identified problem, namely integrating security architectural constraints within already established testing infrastructure.  The second part, a sample study, aimed to achieve generalizability by composing security architectural constraints that were not tied to a specific domain and later evaluating the performance of the tool when applied to several systems.

%We evaluated ArchUnit in two ways, comparing it to the two industry used and open-source static analysis tools SonarQube and PMD, as well as a separate analysis focusing solely on ArchUnit. The separation had to be made as an initial assessment of both SonarQube and PMD showed that they could not track information flow. 

%In the section to follow, the design of the experiment is described in detail. 

\subsection{Comparison to reference tools}\label{sec_tools_used_in_comparison}
In order to test how reliably SecArchUnit can validate the constraints, we perform a comparison with two static analysis tools widely adopted in industry: SonarQube and PMD.
While these tools have a multitude of built-in rules, none of these rules can be used to enforce the architectural security constraints presented in this thesis. However, both tools are extensible, allowing a developer to define custom rules using their respective APIs.

An initial assessment of the tools determined that constraints 1-5 are possible to implement and validate using SonarQube and PMD. Constraints 6-7, however, track the flow of information in the system, which neither of these tools inherently support. While it should be possible to extend these tools with such analysis, doing so is outside the scope of this thesis.
%In addition, these tools evaluate a rule on a single class at a time which further hinders any attempts to track information flow between multiple classes.
Hence, the first five constraints are evaluated in SecArchUnit, SonarQube and PMD, whereas the final two constraints are evaluated solely in SecArchUnit.



\subsection{Evaluation metrics}
The included tools will be evaluated in two aspects: performance and usability. Performance relates to the ability to detect violations of a constraint reliably, whereas usability relates to time required to implement the constraints and how well the tool captures the concepts used in architectural descriptions. The following sections provide further detail for each aspect.

\subsubsection{Performance}
The performance metrics that were chosen to represent how reliably the tools detect violations of security constraints are precision $P$ and recall $R$. They are defined as follows:

\[ P = TP / (TP + FP) \]
\[ R = TP / (TP + FN) \]

A true positive (TP) is a report of a line containing a security constraint violation corresponding to an equal in the ground truth. A false positive (FP) refers to the report of a violation not listed in the ground truth. Finally, a false negative (FN) is the failure to report a violation listed in the ground truth. As the mechanism of reporting a violation differed among the included tools, some tolerance was employed regarding the line at which a violation was reported. For example, a method that receives user input could either be reported inside the method body or at its declaration.

The imbalance between the designer, who needs to ensure that every single aspect of a system is secure, and the attacker, who needs to succeed only once, influences the relative importance of the two metrics. Precision, which represents the probability of a reported violation, indeed being a violation, is relevant as the time allocated for fixes is limited. However, recall, which represents the probability of a violation being detected, is paramount as a single missed security constraint violation could be exploited. Consequently, recall was given greater weight when evaluating the results of the tools.

\subsubsection{Usability}
A significant aspect of applying new tools to a project is the time needed for training. Although SecArchUnit can integrate into existing testing infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines, the implementation of appropriate security architectural constraints is a non-trivial issue. Logging the time needed to implement the constraints included in the study was used as an estimate of the effort needed to construct new constraints. The first two constraints were considered as learning examples to reduce the bias introduced by us having more experience of using SecArchUnit.

Additional usability aspects concern how custom rules are defined in the different tools; whether the rules are specified at a proper level of abstraction for expressing security architectural constraints, and how conveniently the rules can be applied to a system.

\subsection{Subjects of analysis} \label{sct:selected-systems}

Several requirements were formed to guide the selection of projects to be included in the evaluation of our study. While some were necessary due to the languages supported by ArchUnit, others served to decrease the threats to validity. Detailed below is the final list of requirements for inclusion:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The project must be open source}. The constraints defined in SecArchUnit cannot be applied to a system without access to the source code.
    \item \textbf{The source code must be written in Java}. As SecArchUnit does not support any other language, a strict requirement had to be made regarding the language. 
    \item \textbf{The project must be previously used in literature concerning security}. Using projects already analyzed in previous literature would reduce the bias of the ground truth. 
    \item \textbf{The project must include some form of architectural description}. Architectural description would allow the constraints to be appropriately placed on a system in regards to the security requirements which it has been developed for.
\end{enumerate}

Based on the presented criterion, three systems were selected for the evaluation: JPetStore, ATM Simulation and iTrust. All projects had previously been included in a study on secure data flow by Peldszus et al \cite{peldszus_secure_2019}. A summary of the characteristics for each system can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:sample_systems}. A more detailed description of each system is seen below:

\textbf{JPetStore}, originally designed as an example of how to use the J2EE framework, is built on top of MyBatis 3, Spring and the Stripes framework. The application is a minimal implementation of an online pet store. In addition to the inclusion of JPetStore in security litterateur, It has been used both as an industry benchmark application as well in studies on application performance \cite{luo_forepost_2017}.

\textbf{ATM Simulation} is, as the name suggests, a simulation of an atm machine. It features all the expected functions of an atm, such as money withdrawal, money deposit and balance checking. 

\textbf{iTrust} is a web based electronic health records system. Originally designed as a part of a software evolution course at NSCU \cite{heckman_10_2018}, the project has been used in the domain of software traceability \cite{cleland-huang_software_2012}, requirements engineering \cite{massey_aligning_2008} and security \cite{burger_framework_2018, xiao_automated_2012}.

         \hline
    \end{tabular}
    
    \label{tab:sample_systems}
\end{table}

\subsection{Ground truth}
A ground truth had to be set to validate the results of applying the tools to the included projects. The ground truth consisted of the following items: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item A set of classes applicable to the concepts defined in the final list of constraints. An example included the set of classes deemed to represent the security services in a system. 
    \item Annotations to the source code, in cases where a constraint relied on additional information within the source code to identify a particular concept.
    \item A list of violations found within the source-code, linked both to the precise location and to a particular constraint.
\end{itemize}

In the absence of any previously established ground truth, in large because we defined the constraints, a structural analysis was performed for each of the systems. Our analysis was guided by the architectural descriptions supplied with the projects and the extraction of SecDFDs by Peldszus et al. \cite{peldszus_secure_2019}. An overview of the steps performed can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:ground_truth}. Each constraint was applied to the system by analyzing every file in the project in a separate pass, as seen in the first step in figure~\ref{fig:ground_truth}. Although time-consuming, performing a complete scan of the entire system for each constraint reduced the risk of wrongfully dismissing a class and ensured that violations were detected.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/GroundTruth.png}
    \caption{An overview of the process of establishing the ground truth.}
    \label{fig:ground_truth}
\end{figure}

In order to reduce the bias of the ground truth, the analysis was performed individually, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ground_truth} by the presence of two parallel processes, later comparing the results. In cases were the classification differed, such as when only one other considered a class to represent a certain security concept, a careful review of the reasoning behind each author's choice was performed, resulting in a combined decision, as seen in the last step in Figure~\ref{fig:ground_truth}. In addition, our supervisors were consulted in cases where we were unable to reach a consensus.

An excerpt of the ground truth is included in Appendix~\ref{chap:groundtruth}. The complete set of data, along with our extensions to ArchUnit, can be accessed trough our public repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MarcusRandevik/SecArchUnit}}.
