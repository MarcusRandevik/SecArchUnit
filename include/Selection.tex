\chapter{Selection of Architectural Security Constraints}

This chapter describes the methodology of collecting a final list of security constraints from three sources. 

\section{Collection of Security Measures}

The processed collection of security measures can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:all_measures}.

\section{Final Selection}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:limitations}, the aim is not to demonstrate the enforceability of as many constraints as possible, but rather to investigate the feasibility of using the tool in this manner. To that end, a subset of the full list of security constraints is selected for enforcement. The final list contains 7 architectural security constraints, as this allows us to cover at least one constraint from each goal. The selected constraints can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:selected_measures}. The remainder of this section presents each selected constraint in further detail.

1 & 15 & Methods related to security events must call the logger\\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
2 & 16 & Authentication and authorization must each be enforced in a single component\\
3 & 4 & Every outbound message must be sent from a single component responsible for transmissions\\

\subsection{Log all security events \checkmark} 

\textbf{Description:} In any system, several components either directly change or process data, which represents the system's asset, or indirectly by invoking other components to act on its behalf. In either case, the request to perform a particular action originates from an actor (user or external process) who should later be held accountable.  As a consequence, the system should log a security event before performing an action that could breach the specified security policies. Although the term security event has become somewhat ambiguous, the definition used in the context of this report comes from the SANS Institute: "An event is an observable occurrence in an information system that actually happened at some point in time." \footnote{\url{https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/events-incidents-646}}

\textbf{Typical enforcement:} The usage of the \textit{audit interceptor} forces all requests from a user to first be sent to a component responsible for logging the request and later forwarding it to the intended target. 

\textbf{Sources:} CAWE 223/778, Jasser rule 5, Security pattern \textit{Audit interceptor}

\textbf{Attack scenario:} A typical scenario where the logging of security events increases a system's resilience to attacks is that of failed login attempts. An attacker may try and guess the credentials of a user by employing a brute-force attack. During the attack, the attacker performs several failed attempts at guessing the credentials, (hopefully) causing the system to either increase the time between repeated attempts or lock the account entirely though with the added effect of decreased availability for the intended user. Although this type of defense temporarily hinders the attacker, a log of failed attempts facilities the detection of malicious actors and enables administrators to impose more permanent measures. 

\subsection{Enforce AuthN/AuthZ at single point}
 
 \textbf{Description:} Any system that has more than one user needs to incorporate functionality for authentication (AuthN), as well as authorization (AuthZ) if the privileges between users differ. The difficulty in complex systems where components handle different functionality, thus receiving separate requests and creating multiple entry points, is the fact that the components may have been designed to use various mechanisms of authentication. Instead, AuthN/AuthZ should be delegated to a single component to ensure consistent behavior across all entry points. 
 
 \textbf{Typical enforcement:} Designing a single component responsible for AuthN/AuthZ mechanisms across several points of entry. Several third-party libraries exist that provide such features as well as language extending specifications such as Jakarta EE (formerly J2EE). 
 
 \textbf{Sources:} CAWE 288/420/592, Security pattern \textit{Authentication enforcer} and \textit{Authorization enforcer}
 
 \textbf{Attack scenario:} In system where the following conditions are true:
 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item There are multiple points of entry; 
     \item There are different mechanisms to provide AuthN/AuthZ, some having a greater certainty that a user is \todo[inline]{add word for what is greater}
     \item and all points of entry share the same session object
 \end{itemize}
 
  An attacker may try and gain access to the least trusted point of entry and later use the granted authority to access services or operation normally requiring a greater level of trust.

\subsection{Messages are sent from a central point} \checkmark

\textbf{Description:} 
Communication with external actors, whether they are a client connecting to a server, or the system requesting data from a third party, is commonly performed over insecure networks. Encryption is the preferred method of securing such communication against potential attackers. However, it is challenging to implement an encryption algorithm correctly as a seemingly small deviation might affect the algorithm's mathematical soundness. Having a single component responsible for any outbound communication reduces the risk of introducing an implementation error, potentially causing an otherwise sound algorithm to be insecure.
 
 \textbf{Typical enforcement:} 
 A single component is responsible for establishing, performing, and closing external communications. This component may be a part of a network library or implemented inside of the system. 
 
 \textbf{Sources:} Jasser rule 11
 
 \textbf{Attack scenario:}
 A banking system may properly use a delegated component for the transmission of some of the most critical data (e.g. credit card numbers) but fail to do so for others (e.g. bank account numbers). An attacker who monitors network traffic at an open wireless network can thus intercept the packets and directly read and/or alter the data sent between the user and the system. If the user were to initiate a money transfer, the attacker could potentially change the recipient's account number. 

\subsection{Validate user input}

\textbf{Description:} 
The ability to receive and process user input is fundamental to every computer system. However, the same input is also the primary source of untrusted data as an attacker possesses full control of what the system receives. Assuming that all data passed to a system is safe to process can have severe consequences when interpreting user input as a part of a query, often referred to as injection. In order to prevent an attacker from compromising the system by injection, all user input must be validated.
 
 \textbf{Typical enforcement:}
 
 \todo{Perhaps change the number of mentioned entries}
 \textbf{Sources:} CAWE 20/59/74-79/88-91/93-99/138/150/349/352/472/473/502/601/\newline/641/643/652/790-797/942, Security pattern \textit{input guard}
 
 \textbf{Attack scenario:}

\subsection{Restrict thread spawning}

\textbf{Description:} Computers have finite resources in terms of memory, CPU time and network bandwidth. Systems should be designed with this in mind, employing measures to avoid exhausting the computer's resources. This constraint limits the number of threads that can be spawned on behalf of actors, which could otherwise lead to exhaustion of the CPU.
 
 \textbf{Typical enforcement:} Dispatching tasks to a pool of worker threads that is not allowed to grow beyond a fixed size. Moreover, various mechanisms are employed to throttle or limit requests such that a single actor cannot occupy all of the allotted threads.
 
 \textbf{Sources:} CAWE 770
 
 \textbf{Attack scenario:} An attacker may initiate many requests that are each handled by the system in a separate thread. By initiating requests at a higher rate than the server is able to process them, the resources at the server are eventually exhausted. This leads to a denial of service to any legitimate actors attempting to access the system.

\subsection{Sensitive information must stay within trust boundary}\todo{Patrik}

\textbf{Description:} 
 
 \textbf{Typical enforcement:}
 
 \textbf{Sources:} CAWE 488
 
 \textbf{Attack scenario:}

\subsection{Secrets must not be exposed in log messages}\todo{Patrik}

\textbf{Description:} Many systems handle secrets that should never touch permanent storage. A password is perhaps the most common example of such a secret. While great care can be taken on the design level to ensure that these secrets are not stored to disk, they may still be exposed unintentionally through log messages. In order to prevent such exposure, messages that are sent to the logger must not contain secrets.

 \textbf{Typical enforcement:} A typical approach is to manually review log statements and ensure that they do not expose any secrets. As for automated enforcement, various information flow analysis tools, like JOANA\footnote{\url{https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/projects/joana/}}, can be employed to detect these types of information leaks within a system.
 
 \textbf{Sources:} CAWE 359/532, Jasser rule 13
 
 \textbf{Attack scenario:} Log messages may be accessible to actors who are not otherwise granted direct access to the secrets. By exploiting an unintentional leak of secrets into the log messages, an attacker could systematically extract these without facing the intended restrictions.
