\chapter{Selection of Architectural Security Constraints}

This chapter describes the methodology of collecting a final list of security constraints from three sources. 

\section{Collection of Security Measures}

The processed collection of security measures can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:all_measures}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lp{7cm}lll}
\hline
\textbf{\#} & \textbf{Measure} & \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Sub-goal} \\
\hline
1  & Exceptions should not reveal sensitive information to the client & Confidentiality & Reveal \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
2  & Do not allow sensitive information to bleed to other components & Confidentiality & Reveal \\
3  & Do not send or receive sensitive information in plain text & Confidentiality & Transmit \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
4  & Every outbound message is sent from a central point of the system & Confidentiality & Transmit \\
5  & Strip and validate data before it passes a trust boundary & Confidentiality & Store \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
6  & Do not log secrets & Confidentiality & Store \\
7  & The system must not provide functionality to decrypt secured log messages & Confidentiality & Store \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
8  & Ensure erroneous output is not propagated between components & Integrity & Fault tolerance \\
9  & Input from a user is validated & Integrity & - \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
10 & The user never accesses the session object & Integrity & - \\
11 & Checkpointed system & Availability & Recoverability \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
12 & Limit and/or throttle allocation of resources & Availability & Resource usage \\
13 & Provide a single point of access to the system & Accountability & - \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
14 & There is at least one checkpoint initialized for both tasks: authentication and authorization & Accountability & - \\
15 & Log all security relevant events with appropriate information & Accountability & Auditing \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
16 & Enforce authentication at a central point of the system & Accountability & Authentication \\
17 & Enforce authorization at a central point of the system & Accountability & Authorization \\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
18 & Every security-relevant log message must be secured & Accountability & Non-repudiation \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Security measures and their related goals.}
\label{tab:all_measures}
\end{table}

\section{Final Selection}

Out of the larger collection of security measures, we have selected 7 entries from diverse security goals and formulated them as architectural security constraints. The selected constraints can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:selected_measures}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\textbf{\#} & \textbf{Constraint} \\
1 & Log all security events with relevant information\\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
2 & Enforce authentication/ authorization at a single point in the system\\
3 & Every outbound message is sent from a central point of the system\\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
4 & Input from a user is validated\\
5 & Allocation of resources is limited or throttled\\
\rowcolor{RowColor}
6 & Do not allow sensitive information to bleed to other components\\
7 & Do not log secrets\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{List of constraints that have been selected for enforcement.}
\label{tab:selected_measures}
\end{table}
