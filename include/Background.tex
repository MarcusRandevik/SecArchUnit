\section{Software architecture}
\textbf{Although not intended to provide any contribution to the definition of software architecture, our work relies on a shared understanding of what constitutes as architecture}

\textbf{Initially considered by Djikstra in the organisation of systems and by Parnas \cite{broy_criteria_1972, parnas_design_1976}, the term was introduced by \cite{perry_foundations_1992} later to be segmented by \cite{ambriola_introduction_1993}}

\textbf{Today, there are mainly two defintions used where one is concernd with the structure of system components and their relations \cite{bass_software_2013} whereas the other focuses on the major decision \cite{jansen_software_2005} later representing these within views. Common to both is the fact that they focus on the overall structure of a system}

\textbf{Another common element is the realization that architecure is a trade-off between quality attributs}

\textbf{Further clarification regarding the distinction between the design and the architecture \cite{eden_architecture_2003}using extensional and non-local criteria}
