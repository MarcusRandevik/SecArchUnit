\chapter{Conclusion}
We presented an investigation and empirical evaluation of using and extending the ArchUnit framework to support the validation of security architectural constraints and compared it to SonarQube and PMD. The analysis covered both the ability to reliability detect violations of constraints as well as the architectural appropriateness. We based the evaluation on a set of constraints gathered from architectural patterns, rules, and weaknesses. The constraints were applied to three open-source systems, the largest containing over 28k lloc. Our results show that while all tools were able to perform similarly in their ability to detect a subset of the composed violations, SecArchUnit was the only one with the ability to detect violations concerning the flow of information.  

\textbf{Future research}

Productivity when applying the tool to a new project

Decreased architectural violations over time
