\chapter{Ground Truth Tables}\label{chap:groundtruth}

This appendix contains an excerpt of our ground truth focusing soley on the ATMSimulator system. The entriety of the data can be found in our public repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MarcusRandevik/SecArchUnit/blob/master/Validation/Validation.xlsx}}. 

The data presented here consists of three tables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Table~\ref{tab:groundtruthviolations} contains the identified violations of all constrains in ATMSimulator. It is this data that the tools were evaluated against.
    \item Table~\ref{tab:groundtruthconceptincluded} contains the concepts of our constraints that were applied to the target system. These were later used to identify the violations of constraints in Table~\ref{tab:groundtruthviolations}.
    \item Finally, Table~\ref{tab:groundtruthconceptnotincluded} presents concepts that were considered by at least one author but later discarded and not included when forming the ground truth. 
\end{itemize}
