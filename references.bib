	abstract = {Software security issues have been a major concern in the cyberspace community, so a great deal of research on security testing has been performed, and various security testing techniques have been developed. Threat modeling provides a systematic way to identify threats that might compromise security, and it has been a well-accepted practice by the industry, but test case generation from threat models has not been addressed yet. Thus, in this paper, we propose a threat model-based security testing approach that automatically generates security test sequences from threat trees and transforms them into executable tests. The security testing approach we consider consists of three activities in large: building threat models with threat trees; generating security test sequences from threat trees; and creating executable test cases by considering valid and invalid inputs. To support our approach, we implemented security test generation techniques, and we also conducted an empirical study to assess the effectiveness of our approach. The results of our study show that our threat tree-based approach is effective in exposing vulnerabilities. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Although security plays an important role in the development of multiagent systems, a careful analysis of software development processes shows that the definition of security requirements is, usually considered after the design of the system. One of the reasons is the fact that agent oriented software engineering methodologies have not integrated security concerns throughout their developing stages. The integration of security concerns during the whole range of the development stages can help in the development of more secure multiagent systems. In this paper we introduce extensions to the Tropos methodology to enable it to model security concerns throughout the whole development process. A description of the new concepts and modelling activities is given together with a discussion on how these concepts and modelling activities are integrated to the current stages of Tropos. A real life case study from the health and social care sector is used to illustrate the approach.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an original security testing approach guided by risk assessment, by means of risk coverage, to perform and automate vulnerability testing for Web applications. This approach, called Risk-Based Vulnerability Testing, adapts Model-Based Testing techniques, which are mostly used currently to address functional features. It also extends Model-Based Vulnerability Testing techniques by driving the testing process using security test patterns selected from risk assessment results. The adaptation of such techniques for Risk-Based Vulnerability Testing defines novel features in this research domain. In this paper, we describe the principles of our approach, which is based on a mixed modeling of the System Under Test: the model used for automated test generation captures some behavioral aspects of the Web applications, but also includes vulnerability test purposes to drive the test generation process.},

	abstract = {We present a semi-automated approach, SECORIA, for analyzing a security runtime architecture for security and for conformance to an object-oriented implementation. Type-checkable annotations describe architectural intent within the code, enabling a static analysis to extract a hierarchical object graph that soundly reflects all runtime objects and runtime relations between them. In addition, the annotations can describe modular, code-level policies. A separate analysis establishes traceability between the extracted object graph and a target architecture documented in an architecture description language. Finally, architectural types, properties, and logic predicates describe global constraints on the target architecture, which will also hold in the implementation. We validate the SECORIA approach by analyzing a 3,000-line pedagogical Java implementation and a runtime architecture designed by a security expert.},
